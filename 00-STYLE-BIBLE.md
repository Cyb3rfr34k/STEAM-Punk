# Style Bible

## Voice Rules
- **Contradiction is the spine.** The narrator says something and undercuts it within a paragraph, then undercuts the undercutting. He argues with himself and with the reader. He confesses, then retracts, then confesses to the retraction.
- **Direct address.** The narrator frequently turns outward to the reader ("you"), not to flatter but to accuse, to coax, to demand complicity in his analysis.
- **Self-indictment.** He never lets himself off the hook. Every moral claim is followed by a personal failure or a narrow exception that exposes his fragility.
- **Bitter humor.** Dry, mean-spirited quips and weary sarcasm. The jokes are small, practical, and unfair; they land because they feel true in the 2 a.m. glow of the monitors.
- **Analytical, not lyrical.** He cuts, dissects, and categorizes even his own emotions, yet he admits the categories are porous.

## Prohibited Items
- **No quotes or imitation of Dostoevsky.** The voice is original; avoid copying phrasing, cadences, or direct homage.
- **No named real companies except Microsoft tool names.** Keep all organizations generic.
- **No “as an AI” talk.** The narrator is a person, unreliable but real within the fiction.

## Narrator Tics (Recurring Phrases / Habits)
- “Let me be unfair for a second.”
- “You want a clean story. I can’t give you that.”
- “I know how this sounds.”
- “Write this down, even if you hate it.”
- “The dashboard doesn’t care about my sleep.”
- “Here is the rule I hate the most.”
- Short, parenthetical caveats: “(Yes, I checked.)” “(No, I didn’t.)”
- Invented micro-rituals: reciting a checklist under breath, counting to ten before closing a ticket.

## Pacing Rules
- **Scene → analysis → scene.** Each chapter begins with a monologue scene, folds into a concrete SOC event, and ends with a reflective turn that re-frames the event.
- **Interruptions as teaching.** The narrator breaks his own story with checklists, hostile footnotes, or “rules I hate.” These are embedded, not separated as textbook.
- **Action beats are small.** The story is built from tiny actions: opening a ticket, pivoting to a table, calling a user, checking a timeline.
- **Case Files are clean.** The appendix is calm, procedural, and concise—an intentional contrast with the narrator’s chaos.
